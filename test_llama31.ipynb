According to the context, the S-1 Committee was formed to investigate and recommend research and development of nuclear energy for military and post-war purposes. Specifically, the S-1 Committee meeting on December 18, 1941, recommended pursuing all five technologies, which was approved by Vannevar Bush, James B. Conant, and others. This led to the establishment of the Metallurgical Laboratory in early 1942 to study plutonium and reactors using graphite as a neutron moderator. In essence, the S-1 Committee helped guide the research and development of nuclear energy in the United States during World War II.'"
